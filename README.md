# MamGyp-int-rides-PNMA2

The PNMA family of genes is predicted to have Gag-homology domains (14, 17). In this study, we investigated whether PNMA virus-like properties are responsible for their role in paraneoplastic neurological disorders. Concentrating on the PNMA2 gene, we find that PNMA2 is normally exclusively and highly expressed in neurons.
