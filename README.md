# MamGyp-int-rides-PNMA2

The PNMA family of genes is predicted to have Gag-homology domains. In this study, we investigated whether PNMA virus-like properties are responsible for their role in paraneoplastic neurological disorders. Concentrating on the PNMA2 gene, we find that PNMA2 is normally exclusively and highly expressed in neurons. This repository contains the codes used for the PNMA2 expression analysis and it's visualization.
